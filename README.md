## Game-Description: 
  - You are a snake and a hunter is trying to catch you.
  - You must make it out of the Living Room, Front Door, and Backyard to be safe.
  - You have 5 wrong tries to escape (in the game they are shown as minutes, not tries).
  - To make it out of a round, the snake must guess the correct item from the item list (bird, rat, lizard). Only one item will give the snake enough energy to make it out of each round.
