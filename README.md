# Snake-Snack

# Game-Description: 
  - You are a snake and a hunter is trying to catch you.
  - You must make it out of the Living Room, Front Door, and Backyard to be safe.
  - You have 5 wrong tries to escape (in the game they are shown as minutes, not tries).
  - To make it out of a round, the snake must guess the correct item from the item list (bird, rat, lizard). Only one item will give the snake enough energy to make it out of each round.

# Running-the-Code:
  - For MACOS:
      - Download the SnakeGame.py file
      - Open Terminal
      - Make sure you are in the same directory as the file (eg: if the file is in the Downloads folder -> cd Downloads)
      - Run this code in the terminal: python SnakeGame.py
